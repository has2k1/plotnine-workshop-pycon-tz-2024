# This script is not necessary for students.
# It contains notes on how the original project was set up,
# in order to allow students to start right away, without
# needing to install dependencies.

# note that uv will not be inside student projects,
# since it is installed outside the project directory
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# this ensures that uv installs python within
# our project directory. Otherwise, it won't be
# included when students recreate it.

# sync uv ----
# creates a virtual environment in the project's .venv folder

# set python kernel ----
# the key here is that it matches the name of the kernel
# set inside the jupyter notebooks
#
# source .venv/bin/activate
# ipython kernel install --name "python3" --user
